## Recursive Functions
Consists to break an issue into tinny chunks by aiming the fundamental root to its composition. This is called CASE BASE --first return--, and this may have more than one.
After that, the function has to call itself returning kind of a regressive counting to equalize to some of their Cases-Base --if more than one--, this is called as RECURSIVE CASE.
Obviously, there are several different ways of coding for solving these problems, but these were the manner that I found by myself, so suggestions are very well welcome.
As soon as I can, I'll bring more Recursive solutions here, in C# as well as in other programming languages, like C++, JavaScript, Python. Cheers! Happy coding.
